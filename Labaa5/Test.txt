aviation experts hope that ordinary planes will soon be replaced with some new form of supersonic transport.

and designers from Paris presented the project a supersonic passenger liner 

This plane look like a rocket and will fly at a speed five times above the speed of sound and will fly in the stratosphere, because there it is colder and less air resistance

The plane of future will have no window, because windows will make the structure too weak 



thanks to the use of new composite materials, it was possible to reduce weight 

the scientists decided to use liquid hydrogen as fuel, which would cool the case before burning

 experts from other countries have developed a new fan motor special for supersonic plane, which will be considered more economical, lighter and less noisy
